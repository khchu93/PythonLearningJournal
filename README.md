# PythonLearningJournal
Personal repository to track what Iâ€™ve learned about Python from exercises, work, and experiments.

### What is:

**!** (ex. !pip install python) <br>
Definition: Run this command in the underlying shell (bash) instead of Python. <br>
Use case: !pip, !scp, etc

if **not** [variable]:
Definition: This code checks for falsy values (e.g., boolean False, int 0, empty ([], '', ""), special constant None)

[element] = [list].**pop([int])**
Definition: pop the int variable of the list (e.g., 0 = first, -1 = last)

id([variable])
Definition: return the id of the variable. It can be used to check if you're working on a reference of the same variable or a new variable.
